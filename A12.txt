The game will be about an unnamed spy that is referred to only as "Agent 12." 
Agent 12's job is to infiltrate the Ministry of State Security of the People's Republic of 
China's main server located in Beijing to install a virus designed to locate all local US 
intelligence and report to the CIA.

Agent 12 will have many obstacles to defeat, including but not limited to passing through 
main security, locating the main server room, navigating through access ducts, silencing 
and mitigating main server security, and hacking the main server. Agent 12 must then 
escape the MSS after planting the virus. 

The various hacking puzzles should be small games such as guessing codes, hacking passwords, 
etc. Maybe solving riddles. 

Perhaps A12 can gain XP and defeat enemies though various skills?

Maybe give A12 a tablet or some spy technology that has a dossier on each official they
will come in contact with. Could assist in hacking passwords.

Main scenes:
* Death - The spy is killed by someone or something. There are hidden traps throughout
		  the MSS that kill the spy.
		  
* Capture - The spy is captured by the MSS.
 
* Manhole entrance outside MSS - A12 must sneak in through the manhole outside of the MSS
		  A12 runs into a crew of MSS guards and s/he must pick between a few different routes.

* 2nd floor office terminal - A12 must hack in to a low-level official's computer to find
		  a building map. A12 must use her/his dossier to find information to hack the password.

* Camera room - A12 must hack into the camera server and loop the cameras. If A12 doesn't
		  stop the loop correctly in order to correct the feed loop.

* Main server room - A12 must hack into the main server and plant the virus.
